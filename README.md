# Pymaceuticals-starter-Mod-5

In the first section of this data I merged two data files and then cleaned the data of any duplicate data. 

In the second section of the data I summarized the data for each drug to find the mean, median , variance, standard deviation, and the standard error of mean for the tumor volumes. 

In the third section I used the mice count per drug, row count, and the timepoints to create bar plots.

In the thrid section we used the 'sex' data to create pie charts to show the distribution using pandas and pyplot. 

The fourth section I was calculating the data needed to create a box plot for the selected drugs and to find the outliers. 

In the fifth section I used the data from mouse 1509 to see the relationship between timepoint and tumor volume using a line chart. As well as using the Capomulin data to see the correlation between tumor volume and weight within a scatter plot. 

Finally we used the previously generated scatter plot to insert a regress line and we calulated the correlation between the two data points.
